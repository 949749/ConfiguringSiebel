# Configuring Siebel

What this respository is:

- A selection of code from Siebel Bookshelf, mostly from the Configuriung Open UI book
- A growing respository of re-usable example code for both Open UI and Siebel in general

What this repostitory isn't:

- An open source project to deliver Open UI framework code

## Contributing

Contributions will are actively encouraged. Two types pf contribution are envisaged:

- Improve the party : Fix your code, other people's code, or the code we deliver in Siebel Bookshelf
- Grow the party : Show us how cool you and your team are by sharing you customizations

It's the hope of the Open UI development team that customers, partners, and integrators will share their cunning customizations of Open UI here with us and with each other. At present, a development in London will probably never see the light of day in Australia and vice versa. By sharing, the entire Siebel configuration community will be strengthened and can collaborate together to deliver innovative solutions and robust code. Please feel free to include comments in your contributions with a reference to yourself, your company, and how to get in touch with you for further customization of your work. In this way, your endeavours will not only help others, but could also generate future work.

Please review this [Github Flow] to get started with your contributions if you're not already familiar with Github.
