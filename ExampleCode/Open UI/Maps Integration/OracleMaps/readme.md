# Oracle Maps Integration

This PR is to add an Oracle Maps modal window from the customer form applet using [colorbox](http://google.com)(http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) plug in.
It took me a while to understand how to use the Oracle Maps framework. I hope this is helpful for others.

- Icon is added before the label for Personal Address control
- Latitude/Longitude is calculated from Street Address + Postal Code + City + Country
- Screenshots coming soon
