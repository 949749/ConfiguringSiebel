# Logo
#### Simple
The simplest type of logo change replaces the existing images and alters the sizing slightly to fit. Use the oracle white logo snippet and adapt to your needs. Be wary that if you use a custom image, the path to the image is relative to the location of the CSS file.

#### Complex
If your logo doesn't sit well on the default background colour you could alter the background color, or you could use a little more CSS trickery, as used in the Siebel logo example.
